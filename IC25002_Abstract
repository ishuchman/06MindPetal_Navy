This project investigates ridership trends on the Washington, DC Metro to evaluate the potential
benefits of a proposed late-night express train service. With a focus on areas of high
entertainment and nightlife juxtaposed with residential hubs favored by younger
populations—such as university districts—the study seeks to address transit challenges faced
during off-peak hours. The analysis leverages a robust dataset encompassing historical ridership
data, demographic distributions, and urban mobility patterns, offering a comprehensive
perspective on current transit dynamics.

Central to our approach is the application of a Dijkstra algorithm to optimize potential new
transit lines. This method allows for the efficient identification of optimal routing paths that
connect key nodes within the network, ensuring minimal transit times and maximized
accessibility for target demographics. By integrating these algorithmically derived pathways with
established ridership data, the project forecasts potential trends in service uptake and overall
system load, particularly during late-night hours.

Furthermore, the study explores how this innovative express service could alleviate congestion
on conventional metro lines and enhance the overall commuter experience. By providing a direct
and timely connection between nightlife and residential areas, the proposed service aims to
encourage public transit use among young populations, potentially reducing reliance on personal
vehicles and mitigating urban traffic congestion. The results of this analysis are intended to
inform transportation planning authorities and stakeholders about the viability and projected
impact of implementing a specialized late-night express train service in Washington, DC Metro.
